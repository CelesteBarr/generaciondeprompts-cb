    "The earliest known mention of Spock occurred during a conversation between Star Trek's creator, Gene Roddenberry, and actor Gary Lockwood, in which Lockwood suggested Leonard Nimoy for the role. The trio had previously worked together on Roddenberry's The Lieutenant, in the episode \"In the Highest Tradition\".[39][40] Roddenberry agreed to the idea, but was required to audition other actors for the part.[39] At the time, Roddenberry sought DeForest Kelley to play the doctor character in the pilot, \"The Cage\", but both NBC executives and director Robert Butler wanted Kelley to play Spock. Roddenberry offered the part to both Kelley and Martin Landau, but they both turned him down.[41] When offered, Nimoy accepted the part, but was apprehensive about the make-up, which had not yet been determined.[42]\n",
    "\n",
    "During an interview segment of TV Land's 40th anniversary Star Trek marathon on November 12, 2006, Leonard Nimoy stated that Gene Roddenberry's first choice to play Spock was George Lindsey. Because of the flippant way Nimoy makes the comment, it has been suggested that he was joking. The claim Lindsey was offered the role is given more credibility when Lindsey's close friend Ernest Borgnine writes in his autobiography, \"my hand to God – he turned down the part of Mr. Spock on TV's Star Trek, the role that made Leonard Nimoy famous.\"[43]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Nimoy as Spock in 1967\n",
    "The character evolved from having a metal plate in his stomach, through which he ingested energy, to being a half-Martian in the original 1964 pitch, with a \"slightly reddish complexion and semi-pointed ears\".[44][45] Due to Roddenberry's concern that a Mars landing might take place before the end of the series, Spock's home planet was changed.[46] Lee Greenway conducted the initial makeup tests on Nimoy, but after four or five days, Fred Phillips was asked to take over. Phillips in turn asked John Chambers to create Spock's ears, as he was working on getting an appropriate shade of red for Spock's skin;[47] this idea was later abandoned in favor of a yellow hue because of the effects on black and white television.[47] Nimoy hated the ears, and Roddenberry promised him that if he was still unhappy by the 13th episode then they'd find a way to write them out.[48] The NBC executives were also concerned, as they felt it made the character satanic.[49]\n",
    "\n",
    "At Roddenberry's insistence, Spock was the only character retained for the second pilot, \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\". However, NBC demanded that he be only a background character,[50] and when it went to series, the tips of Spock's ears were airbrushed out on promotional materials.[50] It was during early episodes such as \"The Corbomite Maneuver\" and \"The Naked Time\" that Nimoy came to understand the nature of the character.[51][52] After eight episodes, NBC executives complained to Roddenberry that there was not enough Spock in the series; \"Spockmania\" had begun.[53] In response, Spock was moved to a more prominent role within the series, such as taking the lead role in \"This Side of Paradise\" over Sulu.[54] The popularity of the character caused frictions with Shatner,[55] and rumors spread that he was going to be dropped from the show and replaced as the lead by Nimoy as Spock.[56] A drawn out contract renegotiation at the start of season two resulted in Roddenberry considering whether or not to replace Nimoy and the character.[57] Both Mark Lenard and Lawrence Montaigne were seriously considered.[58]\n",
    "\n",
    "The character continued to develop, with Nimoy creating the Vulcan salute during the filming of \"Amok Time\". This was based on a Jewish Kohen he had seen as a child.[59] During the course of the season, a rift grew between Nimoy and Roddenberry and by the end of the year, they only spoke through formal letters.[60] After the departure of producer Gene L. Coon and the stepping back of Roddenberry during the third season, Nimoy found that the writing of Spock deteriorated. In particular, he did not like the character being made a fool of during the episode \"Spock's Brain\".[61] The interracial kiss between Kirk and Uhura in \"Plato's Stepchildren\" had been intended by the writers to be between Spock and Uhura, but Shatner persuaded them to change it.[62]\n",
